                <span>Bully through internet</span>
               <p>Extreme mood, energy, and behavioral swings are characteristics of bipolar
                disorder, a chronic mood illness. The primary symptoms of bipolar disorder
                are manic and hypomanic episodes, with depressive episodes also occurring in
                the majority of cases. With the help of medication, talk therapy, lifestyle
                modifications, and other treatments, the illness is controllable.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
                        <p>This case study investigates the issue of cyberbullying within the University of Cyberjaya, focusing on its prevalence, impacts, and potential solutions. As digital interactions become an integral part of student life, understanding and addressing cyberbullying has become increasingly crucial. This report aims to shed light on the extent of cyberbullying at the university, examining how it affects students and exploring effective measures to combat this growing concern.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Objective</h1>
                
                        <p>The primary objective of this case study is to investigate the prevalence and impact of cyberbullying among students at the University of Cyberjaya. This study aims to assess how frequently cyberbullying occurs, identify the specific types and platforms involved, and evaluate the emotional and psychological effects on victims. Additionally, the research seeks to review current prevention and intervention measures and provide recommendations for improving awareness, support systems, and policies to better address and mitigate cyberbullying at the university.</p>


                    <h1 class="heading">Definition of Cyberbullying </h1>
                        <p>Cyberbullying involves the use of digital platforms—such as cell phones, computers, and tablets—to harass, intimidate, or harm others. This behavior can manifest through various forms of communication, including text messages, social media posts, emails, and online forums. Actions such as spreading harmful content, sharing private information without consent, and impersonating others fall under the umbrella of cyberbullying. Some instances of cyberbullying can escalate into criminal behavior, highlighting its serious nature.</p>
                       

                    <h1 class="heading">Usage of Technologies</h1>
                        <p>The rapid advancement and pervasive use of technology among students have created new avenues for cyberbullying. Recent studies reveal that technology use among adolescents has increased significantly. For instance, in 2005, more than half of students aged 12 to 17 used online applications daily, and by 2006, 93% of U.S. students in this age group accessed the internet regularly. Research by Hinduja and Patchin (2010) indicates that a large majority of students use cell phones and social media platforms frequently, which can inadvertently facilitate cyberbullying. As technology use continues to grow, so does the potential for online harassment.</p>

                    <h1 class="heading">Types of Cyberbullying</h1>
                    <p>Cyberbullying manifests in various detrimental forms:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Harassment: Repeatedly sending offensive or abusive messages.</li>
                        <li>Flaming: Engaging in heated, often aggressive, arguments online.</li>
                        <li>Exclusion: Intentionally leaving someone out of online groups or activities.</li>
                        <li>Doxing: Publicly sharing someone’s private information without permission.</li>

                        <li>Impersonation: Creating fake profiles to damage someone’s reputation.</li>
                        <li>Outing: Revealing embarrassing or private details about someone.</li>
                        <li>Cyberstalking: Persistent, unwanted digital surveillance and harassment.</li>
                        <li>Trolling: Posting provocative or inflammatory content to upset others.</li>

                        <li>Catfishing: Using fake identities to deceive others, typically for romantic or financial gain.</li>
                        <li>Frapping: Hacking social media accounts to post damaging content.</li>

                    <h1 class="heading">Effects of Cyberbullying</h1>
                        <p>The impacts of cyberbullying are multifaceted and severe:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Emotional and Psychological: Victims often experience increased anxiety, depression, and diminished self-esteem, leading to feelings of worthlessness and emotional distress.</li>
                            <li>Social: Victims may withdraw from social interactions, both online and offline, resulting in isolation and difficulties forming and maintaining relationships.</li>
                            <li>Physical: The stress associated with cyberbullying can cause physical symptoms, including insomnia, headaches, and stomach issues. In extreme cases, victims may resort to self-harm as a coping mechanism.</li>
                        </ul>


                    <h1 class="heading">Prevention of Cyberbullying </h1>
 <p>Effective prevention strategies include:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>Education: Raising awareness about the nature and effects of cyberbullying among students, parents, and educators.</li>
    <li>Privacy Controls: Setting strict privacy settings on social media and being cautious about accepting requests from unknown individuals.</li>
    <li>Support Systems: Establishing counseling and support resources for victims.</li>
    <li>Community Engagement: Promoting anti-cyberbullying campaigns and involving social media platforms in prevention efforts.</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="heading">Causes of Cyberbullying</h1>
                    <p>Cyberbullying often stems from various underlying issues:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anonymity: The perceived anonymity of the internet can embolden individuals to act in ways they might not in person.</li>
                        <li>Revenge: Individuals may use cyberbullying as a means of retaliation.</li>
                        <li>Attention Seeking: Those seeking validation may engage in cyberbullying to draw attention to themselves.</li>
                        <li>Mental Health Issues: Problems such as low self-esteem or poor impulse control can contribute to harmful behaviors.</li>
                        <li>Lack of Empathy: Some individuals may struggle to understand or care about the impact of their actions on others.</li>
                    </ul>
